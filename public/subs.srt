00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,480
and then instantly hearing no you&#39;re not

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,500
because in my head I fought with that

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,500
every day

have been a part of Mr BEAST&#39;s video

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,480
since the Inception pretty much

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,680
basically I was there when he created

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,079
the channel

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,719

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,940
also his bestie bestie yeah we grew up

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,860
uh we sat at the same lunch table we

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,899
were kind of the only kids who talked

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,760
about like YouTube and video games so a

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,399
bunch of nerds yeah yeah you know the

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,460
Nerds but so we would hang out

24
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,199
afterwards film videos together and we

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,520
just fell in love with doing it yeah

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,440
yeah I feel like the earliest videos you

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
guys made really were capturing that

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,060
that friendship yeah it was just us just

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,920
doing whatever we could think of it

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,200
because there was no rules back then

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,479
there was no like algorithm or anything

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,280
it was just whatever you could film put

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,840
it on YouTube and the videos have blown

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,360
up to the point where now they are

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,680
consistently getting over 100 million

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,259
views each

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
and which is just I can&#39;t even fathom

38
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,159
what like how many people that looks I

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,780
can&#39;t either and you are in almost every

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,880
video yeah you kind of became Chris the

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,159
guy from Mr Beast exactly it was

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,640
actually for the longest time my Twitter

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,740
bio was the guy in Mr Beast videos and

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,500
then about a year and a half ago it

45
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,299
turned into sometimes I&#39;m a Mr Beast

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,280
video oh so the guy part was removed it

47
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,460
was yeah that was removed a long time

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,020
ago like was that anticipating yeah that

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,240
was going to detach from that identity

50
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,979
yeah so for me in my head I was like oh

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
people are gonna instantly start asking

52
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,399
questions if I did that because like

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,200
when you&#39;re trans you think everybody

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,140
knows you&#39;re trans yeah it&#39;s like when

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,719
you&#39;re high yeah it&#39;s exactly like it

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,920
but so I took it out and I was like oh

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
no people are gonna know people are

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,739
gonna nobody ever said anything so I was

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
like that was my first step and I was

60
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,720
like okay okay all right let&#39;s keep

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,700
going yeah I feel like about how many

62
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,220
maybe six months to a year ago I started

63
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,900
to see a change in your appearance yes

64
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,580
you started to look a little bit less

65
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,860
masculine a little bit less beardy yeah

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,360
at the exact same time you look like you

67
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,040
were glowing like you were more excited

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,560
like your posture was better like you

69
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,040
were like excited about life yeah it was

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,260
weird I didn&#39;t realize how unhappy you

71
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,000
looked beforehand yeah looking up old

72
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,120
pictures of you I searched old pictures

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,819
of you and and you could see a dramatic

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,519
shoe but it wasn&#39;t a real smile it was

75
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,879
it was a and it was a performance smile

76
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,680
I mean because like was I sad every

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,540
single day during those times no but

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,640
like in the back of my head it was

79
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,260
something I constantly felt like I

80
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,180
wasn&#39;t being true to myself I wasn&#39;t

81
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,360
being true to the people who were fans

82
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,980
of me because I was hiding my true self

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,800
from them and the thing that was really

84
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,560
keeping me for so long away from like

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,200
who I truly am is how people would react

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,379
I was so scared of like I&#39;m from a small

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,239
town in a conservative area so when I

88
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:23,099
was younger I was like this is my this

89
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,080
little bubble is my entire world how

90
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,780
will they react then I got a little

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,300
older guy I was like maybe maybe one day

92
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,360
and then I got famous and my bubble went

93
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,340
from this small little town to hundreds

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,519
of millions of people you&#39;ve had a lot

95
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,080
of people speculating on your gender

96
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,599
yeah you know just you growing out your

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,659
hair you I mean today you you showed up

98
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,690
fully I did presenting I did as a woman

99
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,239
I did because I am a woman oh

100
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,440
[Music]

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,720
you&#39;ve never said that before I&#39;ve never

102
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,760
said that publicly enough but I I&#39;ve

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,980
been fully like confident in that

104
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,400
decision for over a year now

105
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,500
um I kind of my idea was to kind of play

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,799
catch up with the internet in the way

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,879
that I discover myself like you were

108
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,980
talking about

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,019
um you know six seven eight months ago

110
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,180
my hair started growing out all those

111
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,600
kind of things I wasn&#39;t quite sure

112
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,459
exactly who I was yet but I knew I was

113
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,560
not cisgender

114
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,360
um so I needed the freedom to be able to

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,639
express myself and be able to figure out

116
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,340
who I was and so for a while I was

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,580
trying gender fluid I was like what what

118
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,860
is making me feel like I&#39;m by gender

119
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,699
what is tying me to this you know

120
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,860
masculinity and really it was after a

121
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,400
lot of talking with the therapist and a

122
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,800
lot of like self uh reflection I

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,440
realized it was really just the societal

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,660
pressure of your Christmas Mr Beast

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,820
you&#39;re the guy that starts the fires

126
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,100
you&#39;re the guy that builds the stuff you

127
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,800
know and like my whole life I&#39;ve enjoyed

128
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,259
doing those things but I&#39;ve never really

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
felt like the guy yeah and that becomes

130
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,840
so intrinsically connected with who you

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,199
are that it felt like it was shattering

132
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,360
everything exactly and I was scared that

133
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,580
people would think that I&#39;m magically

134
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,340
gonna become a different person but for

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,100
me I I have no like I&#39;m very proud of

136
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,100
who I was and how I&#39;ve gotten here it

137
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,220
took me a long time to get here yeah but

138
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,919
I&#39;m finally here so I I&#39;m not ashamed of

139
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,259
all of that or anything I&#39;m actually

140
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,539
really proud of it there&#39;s been a huge

141
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,280
huge reaction to this like people are

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,780
like their minds are blown as something

143
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,639
like this happens I knew there was going

144
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,500
to be a big reaction but I thought it

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,840
would stay like you know like in that

146
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,699
YouTube you know everything it&#39;s like

147
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,440
tabloid culture now it&#39;s like every

148
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,080
single thing has some kind of headline

149
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,240
about you and what it means scenes and

150
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,919
the effects on Mr Beast and all these

151
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,900
different things it was crazy I was

152
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,120
trying to take a break I was like okay I

153
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,639
it&#39;s not affecting me too bad but I

154
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,800
don&#39;t need to consume all this media and

155
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,479
attention of myself I&#39;ll delete all my

156
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,400
social media and then I get on Google

157
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,080
and I go to open a new tab and Google

158
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,360
will recommend me articles about myself

159
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,160
but you love Mr Beast and Chris Tyson

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,620

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,820
know about it yeah so we&#39;re just

163
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:21,539
constantly being fed uh articles with

164
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,520
headlines that are just blatantly wrong

165
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,680
right their lives and not only it&#39;s like

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,960
it wasn&#39;t all hate and it wasn&#39;t all

167
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,060
support it was it was from both sides

168
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,699
but there was also like a lot of people

169
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,319
just uh you know they don&#39;t really know

170
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,780
how to talk about trans people so

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
instantly they&#39;re like Chris Tyson comes

172
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,139
out as a trans woman good for them even

173
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,780

175
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,300
today yeah until today with Anthony I

176
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,880
mean I feel like we should

177
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,580
take a moment on that like how does that

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,120
feel publicly saying in front of cameras

179
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,639
that you are a woman I for the longest

180
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,220
time to even say it to some of the

181
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,080
closest friends it would make me like my

182
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,720
hands shake to say I would get so

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,000
nervous but now I can say I&#39;m a woman

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,100
I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;m a woman it&#39;s

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,440
something that&#39;s honestly so freeing and

186
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,199
I think that is part of what the HRT did

187
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,360
for me was being able to accept myself

188
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,580
and being able to look in the mirror and

189
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,139
say yes you are a woman every single

190
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,240
person has something about themselves

191
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,400
that they kind of

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,800
want to be more of yeah you know and

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,539
then they&#39;re insecure about yeah even if

194
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,860
it is just lacking confidence even if

195
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,039
it&#39;s just I want to be a little bit more

196
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,039
confident in myself yeah here you are in

197
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,620
front of hundreds of millions of people

198
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,419
who have been criticizing you for every

199
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,759
single reason in the book and you&#39;re

200
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,620
focusing on the way that you feel when

201
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,419
you are most true to yourself yeah I

202
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,280
mean if you&#39;re if you&#39;re away to

203
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,139
confidence is to wear a dress wear a

204
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,539
dress if your weight of confidence is to

205
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,800
get so swole you look like a bodybuilder

206
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,840
do that is that you&#39;re talking about

207
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,060
Jimmy yeah Jimmy is getting really small

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,979
isn&#39;t it he&#39;s pumping yeah you see his

209
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,479
Twitter he is Jack he is Jack you&#39;re

210
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,940
getting there man out of nowhere until I

211
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,160
get my hands on him oh and not Chris

212
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,720
affect him watch out the Chris effect

213
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,400
isn&#39;t that why all that people say

214
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,819
there&#39;s the Chris effect the Carl effect

215
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,160
like one person can can change or like

216
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:20,639
infect the other brains and the other

217
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,440
friends I mean I&#39;ve always joked that

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,240
there and I hate that people will clip

219
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,160
it but there is a smidgen of truth to it

220
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,740
because Carl came down to North

221
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,159
Carolina&#39;s small town and he had bright

222
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,380
pink hair yeah and I was I was like

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,020
how do you have the confidence to like

224
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,659
go to the grocery store and not feel

225
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,520
like every single person is staring at

226
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,620
you and he&#39;s like I don&#39;t care and I was

227
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,459
like what what you could not care what

228
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,839
others think you can just not care right

229
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,560
I didn&#39;t get the update you know there

230
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,720
is

231
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,580
a little bit of Truth to the idea that a

232
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,839
friend can come into a circle and they

233
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,279
can show you what confidence looks like

234
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,620
yeah they can show you what true

235
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,839
confidence is because for a while like I

236
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,640
was like yeah I guess I&#39;m confident but

237
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,399
it was all fake it wasn&#39;t all real and

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,399
then I saw somebody come in and be

239
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,980
themselves and I was like I want that I

240
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,779
want to be myself and even though like I

241
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,399
saw people make fun of Carl because of

242
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:19,260
his hair he would just shrug it off that

243
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,000
was like I I can do that maybe maybe

244
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,040
give it a couple years you hear that

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,140
Carl you inspired someone you did it you

246
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,140
mentioned taking hormones and you

247
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:32,160
mentioned that it saved your life yes

248
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,100
for so long every day I I would go to

249
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,100
bed and I would have dreams vivid dreams

250
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,660
I was a woman like my whole life and I

251
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,060
would wake up in the morning and it was

252
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,040
just like getting ripped out of a

253
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,420
reality that I didn&#39;t want to be taken

254
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,640
out of so it was like the dream was a

255
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,440
reality yeah there was times where I

256
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,080
would just lay in bed all day and just

257
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,120
sleep because it was more fun to do that

258
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,860
or more enjoyable to me to do that

259
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,920
because the real world I didn&#39;t feel

260
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,920
connected to it I&#39;ve really never felt

261
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,120
connected to my body until I started

262
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,360
taking HRT and like I was amazed like

263
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,120
after two three weeks I just started

264
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,180
having a mental Clarity that it felt

265
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,300
like a fog that had been around me just

266
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,420
went away and I could see things clearly

267
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I could feel confident in who I was I

268
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,360
knew who I was finally surely truly

269
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,940
without a shadow of a doubt and that is

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,640
what really saved my life because for

271
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,580
the longest time you know like in 2017

272
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,220
2018 I started gaining weight I got

273
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,200
really depressed because I pretty much

274
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,120
thought that there was no way I was

275
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,920
going to be able to transition ever and

276
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,320
I was just going to have to keep

277
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,899
marching forward in a life I didn&#39;t want

278
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,700
to live and I was just gonna have to

279
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,260
keep doing that until I couldn&#39;t do it

280
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,140
anymore what was the internal battle

281
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,980
like the thing I really felt hatred

282
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,339
towards was myself for not understanding

283
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,040
myself also internalized transphobia

284
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:08,279
just made me feel you know there&#39;s not a

285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,200
lot of trans people in in general but

286
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,500
there&#39;s also not a lot of trans people

287
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,399
in my area so the only exposure I had to

288
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,320
trans people and trans issues were from

289
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,320
you know the other end of the spectrum

290
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,740
and so I started to hate myself I was

291
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,399
like oh I&#39;m I&#39;m pretending I&#39;m lying I I

292
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,980
like and it took me so many years of I I

293
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,620
ran away I pretended it didn&#39;t exist

294
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,779
multiple times I threw away every single

295
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,420
pair of clothes I ever owned I went to

296
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,459
conversion therapy oh yeah like you

297
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,680
really did not want to be what you felt

298
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,320
at your core was your true self I

299
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,839
thought it was a curse for all of my

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,899
life and it wasn&#39;t until I started

301
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,779
taking HRT that I was like this is

302
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,839
this is not a curse it&#39;s a blessing like

303
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:59,160
I I can finally be myself or did you

304
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,079
have a moment when you first realized

305
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,279
that the way that you identify with your

306
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,040
gender was different than what was

307
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,680
expected of you I was six years old my

308
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,899
sisters went to Camp my parents were in

309
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,760
the living room I told my parents that I

310
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,399
was going to build a popsicle stick

311
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,320
airplane in my room and then I went to

312
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,060
my sister&#39;s room and went in their

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,640
closet and grabbed as much stuff as I

314
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,459
can and locked my door and I turned on

315
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,220
Arthur and it was an episode where there

316
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:28,140
was ballerinas and I just pretended to

317
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,680
be a ballerina and danced around my room

318
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,959
and from that moment on I was like I

319
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
don&#39;t know what this is but I know I

320
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,339
need to hide it because I don&#39;t think

321
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,279
the people I I don&#39;t remember exactly

322
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,260
what made me hide it at such a young age

323
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,500
but I think it was just like you know

324
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,920
growing up in that area going to you

325
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,540
know a very like um very very religious

326
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,779
well all churches are religious but this

327
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,779
one was

328
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,100
religious XXL yeah yeah it was the

329
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,220
premium and because like the biggest

330
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,560
thing is for me I was such a

331
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,420
forward-facing person that any kind of

332
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
changes were instantly going to drum up

333
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,459
questions and so like for me that&#39;s why

334
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,220
I was so glad that even though I had

335
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,800
during this time when I put out that I

336
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,860
was on HRT I was very sure I was a trans

337
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,220
woman I was not ready to come publicly

338
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,920
out yet so I was very happy that like

339
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,519
people were encompassing me into the

340
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,220
gender uh into gender fluid because that

341
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,139
is what I had identified as a while and

342
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,240
and that gave me that ability to dress

343
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,160
more feminine and people not be like are

344
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,200
you a girl or what&#39;s your gender what&#39;s

345
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,899
your gender yeah I mean do you feel like

346
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,600
old Chris is dead dead

347
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:47,760
dead buried Hatchet all of it all of it

348
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
gone I mean you still have uh the

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
reminders through the videos that will

350
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,220
be permanently online for the rest of

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,620
Eternity that&#39;s what I say to people who

352
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,740
were like but I missed the old Chris and

353
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,600
I looked up to you hey go watch the

354
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,920
videos they&#39;ll be there forever was it

355
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,740
more difficult for you to come out to

356
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,279
yourself or to others myself

357
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,100
far more once I came out to myself it

358
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,160
was I came out to myself with my

359
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,200
therapist and and it took like

360
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,260
it took like three therapy sessions

361
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,680
where I was like I&#39;ve known this for a

362
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,040
long time I I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty sure and then

363
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,380
I was you know I I I know like and then

364
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,360
I was like I am a woman and it was it

365
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,959
was hard for me to say that because I

366
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,820
was so scared of saying I am a woman and

367
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,180
then instantly hearing no you&#39;re not

368
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,579
because in my head I fought with that

369
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,440
every day that&#39;s the conversation you

370
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,079
were having with yourself there was a

371
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,560
voice in the back of my head that just

372
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,839
hated me everything I did hated me and

373
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,220
it wasn&#39;t until like I started accepting

374
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,320
myself and being kind to others and like

375
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,060
just listening to what my body wanted

376
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,459
like that&#39;s when that voice started

377
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,959
going away started taking HRT haven&#39;t

378
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,519
heard from that voice in a very long

379
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,800
time where do you think that part of you

380
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,839
is gone I think it&#39;s I hope it&#39;s locked

381
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,839
away do you think it&#39;s disappeared oh

382
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,279
entirely yeah that little piece of it

383
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,860
you must feel like you have so much more

384
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,540
like access to the to your whole self

385
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,779
without that part of you shutting you

386
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,000
down constantly I literally had people

387
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:30,120
within the first like couple of months

388
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,279
of like me coming out to like private

389
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,980
like friends and like my therapist

390
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,680
starting HRT they were like you&#39;ve just

391
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,480
been talking so much more and you just

392
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,060
seem so much more present in the

393
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,699
conversation and I was noticing that

394
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,500
myself too because like I would get done

395
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,779
with conversations and be like why is my

396
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,639
jaw hurt so bad oh I was talking and

397
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,560
smiling I was talking and smiling I

398
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
haven&#39;t done that in a while I mean even

399
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,100
now I feel like people who have watched

400
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,500
you for a long time will see that change

401
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,560
in you wanting to express your thoughts

402
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,540
wanting to express your emotions it

403
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,120
doesn&#39;t matter now if I want to express

404
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,339
them or not they just freely come out of

405
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,680
me because I don&#39;t suppress them anymore

406
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,199
and that is what&#39;s truly the best part

407
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,720
of it is that I can just like what comes

408
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,120
out of my mouth is me now and it&#39;s

409
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,639
nobody else influencing me it&#39;s nobody

410
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,920
telling me I have to be this person it&#39;s

411
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,540
me coming out do you remember the first

412
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,160
time that you looked at yourself and you

413
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,779
were like that is me I&#39;m not ashamed of

414
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,800
that anymore I did I was actually

415
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:33,660
heading to the studio to go film and I

416
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,639
was driving my car and I had something

417
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,320
in my eye and I pulled down my mirror

418
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,420
and I just looked at myself and for the

419
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,120
first time it like hit me that I was

420
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,040
like I&#39;m looking like myself and I just

421
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,839
started crying while driving and I had

422
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,360
to pull over yeah you&#39;re like this this

423
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,060
looks like how I I feel how I see myself

424
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,680
and my dreams yeah and I&#39;ve had so many

425
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,120
moments leading up to them like even

426
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,199
when I went dress shopping today I

427
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
accidentally cried a little bit because

428
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,740
I put on this dress and I was like oh I

429
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,779
gotta love this I feel like you know

430
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,639
whether anyone watching is trans or not

431
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,459
like there&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s such a

432
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,319
relatable feeling to want to be a truer

433
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,059
version of yourself and to to run away

434
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,740
from that for a certain amount of time

435
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,319
for any reason yeah

436
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,179
how does it feel you know like this

437
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,620
you&#39;re constantly finding all these

438
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,679
things that make you feel more and more

439
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:22,679
true to yourself I&#39;ve always been myself

440
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,559
I&#39;m now taking ver uh I&#39;m now taking

441
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,780
steps to make sure I&#39;m the like best and

442
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,580
happiest version because there was a

443
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,380
point in my life where and a lot of

444
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,179
people thought that was the best version

445
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,580
of me because that&#39;s the only thing they

446
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,919
had ever seen Chris from Mr Beast but I

447
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,880
was very unhappy and I was tired and I

448
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,799
was miserable and now I&#39;m like just I

449
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,020
wake up every day and I&#39;m like what are

450
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,480
we doing today I wake up at 7 30. I used

451
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,919
to wake up at 11 30 every single day you

452
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,240
wake up with excitement I wake up it was

453
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
excitement I&#39;m like what are we doing

454
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,740
today what&#39;s going on like you get to

455
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,020
live life yeah I I another day of being

456
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,780
trans that for me it&#39;s like the best

457
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,380
thing why do you think the the news of

458
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,059
you taking HRT and you looking more

459
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,940
feminine why do you think it went so

460
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,980
viral because it&#39;s a really hot button

461
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,200
issue right now there&#39;s a lot of people

462
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,900
putting in their two cents about it and

463
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,780
then I think what really like made a lot

464
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,120
of people focus on it was that I&#39;m just

465
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,419
like I&#39;m just living my life I&#39;m not

466
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,000
saying anything or doing anything I&#39;m

467
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:31,380
just hey I&#39;m on HRT I&#39;m a lot happier

468
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,480
now and um I think that in my opinion A

469
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,360
lot of people were like no we can&#39;t have

470
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,100
somebody this successful in this like

471
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,799
happy being on HRT it&#39;s bad Optics so I

472
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,620
mean if that&#39;s the reason maybe it was

473
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:49,200
just general transphobia maybe they just

474
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,299
don&#39;t like me oh maybe they&#39;re not Chris

475
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,880
fans they might they might be big Nolan

476
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,760
fans so you&#39;re not taking it too

477
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,799
personally though no I I know that at

478
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,480
the end of the day like even the people

479
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,520
that are riding these like crazy

480
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,080
articles about me are probably just you

481
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,059
know normal people that are going home

482
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,160
to see their wife and kids or whatever

483
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:11,220
they&#39;re doing their jobs I&#39;m doing my

484
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,280
job but that&#39;s why I wanted to come to

485
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,080
your show to be able to get a hold of my

486
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,120
narrative again right because you you

487
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,820
lost control of the narrative control

488
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,200
every like ever everyone had an opinion

489
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,760
that had nothing to do with what your

490
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,200
actual thoughts are I know apparently I

491
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
sued people I did it

492
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,340
and they were like Chris is suing me and

493
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,500
then I quote tweeted it and I was like

494
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,059
you better be ready this is my lawyer

495
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,160
and it was a picture of Jimmy with like

496
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,080
sideways sunglasses and people took that

497
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,080
as serious There&#39;s real life

498
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,460
consequences to false things being made

499
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,400
up about you yeah then you have people

500
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,280
making YouTube videos saying that your

501
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,400
decision to be yourself and to openly be

502
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,900
yourself is destroying Mr Beast and it&#39;s

503
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
gonna mess up the business and you

504
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,660
should have thought about that I I

505
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,580
should have thought about that that&#39;s

506
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,980
all how dare you ruin the business by

507
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,380
being your true self how dare you exist

508
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,440
it was kind of weird to see people be

509
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,960
like oh now Jimmy&#39;s put in between a

510
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,059
rock and a hard place where he obviously

511
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,100
doesn&#39;t want to support Chris but the

512
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,840
left would be so mad if he didn&#39;t and

513
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,600
I&#39;m like all these speculation all these

514
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,080
crazy things I told Jimmy like seven

515
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,179
years ago I walked out of my bedroom it

516
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,160
was late I walked out and it was kind of

517
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:31,380
one of those

518
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,760
and then he was like we don&#39;t have to

519
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,860
talk about it if you don&#39;t want to wait

520
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,900
what was it that that gave it away fully

521
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,120
dressed up oh so you&#39;re dressing up as a

522
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,500
woman long before yeah we lived oh I&#39;ve

523
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,020
been I&#39;ve been dressing up as a woman

524
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,120
since I was like six years old

525
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,100
I guess dressing up as a girl now I

526
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,520
messed up as a woman yes but you walked

527
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:54,179
out Jimmy sees you yes dressed up as a

528
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,780
woman yes and he goes we can talk about

529
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,400
this if you want and I was like no

530
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,820
um did you turn around and go into your

531
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,799
room and we didn&#39;t talk about it Jimmy

532
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,600
is really good about if you don&#39;t want

533
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,419
him to bring something up he&#39;ll never

534
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,760
mention it ever again but um it was

535
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,440
about three years ago we were all

536
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,580
hanging out and we were having a good

537
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,140
time

538
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,120
um you know on the channel we like to

539
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,559
say we&#39;re having some apple juice and uh

540
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,780
just drinking some good stuff drinking

541
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,760
some apple juice and there was one

542
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:28,020
moment I was sitting around all the guys

543
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,299
and I had I had just been really like

544
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,120
thinking all that day about like my

545
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,280
gender and everything and combined with

546
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,140
the Apple Juice I just blurted out to

547
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,120
them I don&#39;t want to be a man anymore

548
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,860
just out of nowhere out of nowhere in

549
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,100
front of all of them and then started

550
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,140
like crying and the the support I got

551
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,240
from them in that moment was like that&#39;s

552
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,059
when I knew I was like okay like I have

553
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,559
my friends back everybody else like

554
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,780
that&#39;s all you have the support from

555
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,240
your core group yeah they&#39;re really like

556
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,159
my family do you remember just like what

557
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,080
it felt like to have that out there to

558
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,000
feel like I&#39;m lying to like my best

559
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,820
friends we know everything about each

560
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,620
other like and I&#39;m like this is a huge

561
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,860
part of me and I want to tell them but

562
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,679
like it I&#39;m even so scared to tell them

563
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,020
like even when I used to try to form the

564
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,059
words I would just lock up and couldn&#39;t

565
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,760
talk about it because I was so terrified

566
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:22,980
to like out myself yeah because there&#39;s

567
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,320
so many

568
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,700
so many things that you consider to be

569
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,520
negative that would come out of that

570
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,679
yeah and now I realized that was all an

571
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,720
internalized transphobia my friends

572
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,159
would have accepted me I probably could

573
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,679
have gotten through the process a little

574
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,659
faster yeah but everybody grows at their

575
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,640
own pace and

576
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,919
becomes themselves when they do I mean

577
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,740
you see all these comments on the

578
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,679
internet and no matter how many positive

579
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,020
ones that are there the positive ones

580
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,980
don&#39;t exist but then the negative ones I

581
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,100
think it&#39;s because there&#39;s a little bit

582
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,900
of fear attached to the implications or

583
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,620
what else they might be thinking like

584
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:05,400
those things sit with you and you

585
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,659
accidentally find thousands or in your

586
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,220
case because you have hundreds of

587
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,480
millions of people watching and judging

588
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,700
and commenting on every single thing

589
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,340
that you do you&#39;re likely to see tens of

590
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,740
thousands of comments yeah and sometimes

591
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,140
the algorithm can just be a butt and

592
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,280
just send you all the hates and one one

593
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,380
Fell Swoop but also it&#39;s like you have

594
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,280
to realize that when people are sending

595
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,799
those messages I mean I I was a crappy

596
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,840
kid on the internet I used to be a mean

597
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,120
kid people say those things because

598
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,620
they&#39;re also struggling with things I

599
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,320
would my whole life I was struggling

600
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,299
with my identity who I was I hated

601
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,580
myself like

602
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,159
so every time I see one of those like

603
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,620
hate comments or like people saying mean

604
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,640
things in my DMs I&#39;m like I know that&#39;s

605
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,100
probably somebody who&#39;s going through

606
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,200
something and I just it doesn&#39;t really

607
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,539
bother me I used to see people living

608
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,360
the life I wanted to live and I would

609
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:03,000
get jealous and angry at them and

610
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,580
because and like they get to live this

611
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,440
life and they get to be celebrated and

612
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,720
you know like obviously you don&#39;t see

613
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,460
the hate they get but it&#39;s like they&#39;re

614
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,140
not getting any hate and all this kind

615
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,140
of stuff and and you get into that

616
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:19,200
mindset but then you realize oh that&#39;s

617
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,480
just me just like pointing all that back

618
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,120
at myself and using somebody else as a

619
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,559
Target do you feel like after coming out

620
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,880
and feeling like you can actually be

621
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,039
your truest identity

622
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,299
in addition to not having to hide

623
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,919
something about yourself do you feel

624
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,900
like you&#39;re more

625
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,039
aware and present like do you feel like

626
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,480
instead of living like through with

627
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,640
tunnel vision because you&#39;re blocking

628
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,720

629
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,720

in a in a way they&#39;re going to like try

749
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,340
to use it to dead name me but number one

750
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,260
I can&#39;t be audibly dead named so that&#39;s

751
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,320
pretty true it&#39;s pretty cool it&#39;s a

752

pretty pretty big clutch uh number two I

753
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,419
mean like I said I I have no shame with

754
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,700
like who I was I I think it&#39;s so cool

755
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,700
and interesting that it&#39;s like I was

756
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,919
Chris with a CH and then I put that to

757
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,080
rest and now I can finally be Chris with

758
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,240
a kid you have a permanent Archive of

759
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,159
who you were in your transitional period

760
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,659
and who you are now literally it&#39;s kind

761
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,419
of like the Mr Beast channel was

762
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:24,200
accidentally like my trans timeline it

763
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,200
was a documentary

764
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,840
so you&#39;ve changed your the way you

765
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,980
present you&#39;ve changed the name and the

766
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,220
things that you prefer people to call

767
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,559
you&#39;ve changed your pronouns yeah

768
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,580
have you changed your voice because I

769
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,919
know that that&#39;s something that trans

770
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,820
people also work towards I am working on

771
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,980
it

772
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,320
um So currently I&#39;m working with the

773
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,020
Seattle voice Labs um it&#39;s a Discord

774
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,600
server where they offer free lessons

775
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,539
they offer paid lessons but Claire she

776
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,360
is incredible she&#39;s been teaching me and

777
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,580
she really pushed me to do a voice like

778
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,640
today yeah she wanted you to do it she

779
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,320
thinks I&#39;m ready to do like do a do a

780
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,440
sentence to give it a little sneak peek

781
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
I could feel like myself by like

782
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,860
presenting the way I wanted to grow my

783
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,419
hair out but I would look back when I

784
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,039
got because I&#39;m a YouTuber I get

785
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,200
recorded a lot yeah I would look back

786
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,760
and I would be like that&#39;s me and in my

787
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,299
voice I would open my mouth and I&#39;d be

788
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,620
like that&#39;s not me do you want to say a

789
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,240
sentence or do you want to talk us

790
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,080
through the different types of things

791
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,120
that go into the voice I&#39;m gonna say a

792
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,640
sentence but I&#39;ll kind of also show you

793
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,320
like the process I have to do yeah I

794
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,299
think this will be the first time many

795
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,179
people watching this will have ever seen

796
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:44,399
the thought process behind so I&#39;m in a

797
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:47,159
newer stage I&#39;ve only been going for a

798
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,220
little bit so it&#39;s easier for me to find

799
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,760
that space that feminine Voice by doing

800
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,500
a warm-up it sounds goofy uh whenever I

801
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,140
do it at home I make sure all my doors

802
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,820
are locked so now you&#39;re gonna do it on

803
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,039
your camera do it on camera now there&#39;s

804
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,559
millions of people watching it yeah my

805
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:07,080
voice my voice instructor encouraged me

806
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,299
it won&#39;t sound perfect

807
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,159
um it probably will get picked on a

808
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,380
little bit but that&#39;s kind of what I

809
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,020
like doing is showing people the like

810
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:19,200
real the rawness of it you ready for the

811
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,340
voice I&#39;m ready if you are oh gosh we

812
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,020
might have to do a couple of things

813
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,340
that&#39;s fine that&#39;s fine all right yeah

814
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,539
all right

815
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,539
here you guys sure

816
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,020
hey Anthony congratulations on buying

817
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,020
Smosh

818
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:42,419
the most interesting part about seeing

819
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:44,279
that is it felt like there was like a

820
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,559
Sparkle in your eye something about it

821
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,960
was like you I could see this feeling of

822
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,200
you feeling like yourself yeah and and I

823
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,960
really like showing the process of like

824
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,659
how I get to that because like I think

825
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,399
for a lot of people they they don&#39;t want

826
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:01,020
people to you know hear that process and

827
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,360
that&#39;s completely understandable it&#39;s a

828
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,580
very vulnerable space yeah it takes a

829
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,380
lot of work to even like get to yourself

830
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,899
to the point where you can do that

831
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,179
sometimes without feeling like oh my God

832
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:15,179
like uh I don&#39;t want anybody to hear me

833
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,740
I don&#39;t it&#39;ll never sound right but I

834
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,899
want people to hear that because it&#39;s

835
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,360
like that shows you that it&#39;s like

836
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:24,720
people say oh you&#39;re faking your voice

837
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,539
no I just slid my voice into the right

838
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,700
place basically it&#39;s like I&#39;m as I get

839
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:32,460
better with it I won&#39;t have to basically

840
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,380
push my voice into that place I want it

841
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,480
to be you&#39;re training to get to the

842
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,880
point where it feels natural it&#39;s a

843
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,799
muscle and like every muscle the more

844
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,899
you work it the more you train it it&#39;s

845
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,640
gonna break down build back up get

846
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:46,679
stronger and it&#39;s going to become muscle

847
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,320
memory to do this thing right what are

848
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,799

no but maybe in the future but you

861
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,059
really do have endless possibilities

862
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,880
exactly because I&#39;m finally able to be

863
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:29,640
myself and that spills out into other

864
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,500
areas in my life so it&#39;s not that I&#39;m

865
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,899
just authentically trans now I&#39;m

866
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,600
